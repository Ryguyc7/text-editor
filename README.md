### 🔐 Fonts API (Optional)

This project includes a local font list by default.  
If you'd like to load **all Google Fonts dynamically**, uncomment the API section in `script.js` and replace:

```js
const GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

✅ Place the link **after the code block** and **outside any triple backticks (` ``` )**.

Once you commit this, GitHub will show a **clean, clickable link** like this:

Let me know if you also want to embed a screenshot or add usage instructions!
